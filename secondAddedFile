Currently my local repo, prior to this newly created file is ahead by one commit.
Now with the addition of this file my local is not matched with remote.
I'm going to try `git pull origin main` from my local on `WSL Ubuntu 20.04 on Lenovo K450` that is set with `fast-forward only` and see if this generates an error
